# Week 11 (FINAL)
The final is here!!! It’s been a massive learning experience but honestly I’m so happy with what I made and it’s got me so inspired I am definitely going to take this further and expand upon it in my own time outside of uni. 

You can see it in action here:

Here is the code:

I’ll do a quick update on what’s new and what I would love to do with this.

What’s new?
* Main menu
	* Changed the menu layout and also added controls onto the sketch in a createGraphics() variable.
* New songs
	* Some old songs persist but added some more to make it 10 songs. Also since every key has its own colour I wanted to show as much as possible so each song is in a different key so every song is a different colour.
* Ellipses
	* Small changes to all the ellipses including size and strokes etc.
* Changing songs
	* Figured out a way to change songs and have the duration of the last song to translate into the next
*Bugs
	* Small fixes of the code here and there to make sure it doesn’t break

What would I like to add?
* EQ
	* I found the EQ p5js but didn’t get to include it
* Waveforms
	* I didn’t end up continuing down this path since it was too complex but would love to revisit it
* 3D
	* Another element I used for a split second but also found too complex in the short time I had. But I feel it can elevate this program so I would definitely like to revisit it properly.
* Overall improvements and clean it up
